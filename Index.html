                <h2><em>A little bit about me</em></h2>
                <p>I was born in Romania where I received my Honours Bachelor's Degree in Engineering, specialising in Business Engineering in Agriculture. Shortly after graduating, I started my journey as a European Funds Business Consultant. I had the opportunity to work on a multitude of projects, starting from the creation of the business plan to the final stages of the implementation process. I was also very lucky to work with specialists from different fields, like architects, accountants, lawyers, contractors and beneficiaries with different backgrounds and experience in business. <br> While working as a European Funds Consultant, one of my responsibilities was the preparation of the budgets and financial statements of the projects. I was finding myself spending hours working in excel and loving it and that was the moment I started thinking about a career in accounting. <br> In August 2013, I decided it was the moment to explore new opportunities and so, I moved to Ireland. The excitement of perfecting my English and the discovery of a new culture that suited my personality, made me realise that I want to stay. In the beginning I started working in café’s, to get used to the accent and when I became confident enough, I started the ACCA Diploma in Accounting and Business online course. At the same time, I went back to full time education within Adult and Further Education Centre Newbridge for the Advanced Business studies QQI Level 6, to get a full grip of the business environment of Ireland. <br> I am now eager to continue enhancing my accountancy knowledge while working, and excited to see what the future holds. </p>
